//         Task 1: Using concat
// Objective: Merge two or more arrays.
// Task: Create two arrays, one with your favorite sports and one with your favorite hobbies. Use the concat method to merge them into a single array.
// Expected Output: Display the merged array.
        let a=document.createElement("h1")
        a.innerText="original array"
        let arr=["Cricket","Badminton","Racing"]
        //let array=["palaying games","Reading books","Listing music"]
        console.log(a);
        console.log(arr);
        console.log(arr.concat("palaying games","Reading books","Listing music"));
       // console.log(arr.concat(array))
        
        
//         Task 2: Using splice
// Objective: Modify an array by adding, removing, or replacing elements.
// Task: Create an array of numbers from 1 to 10. Use the splice method to remove the numbers 4, 5, and 6, and replace them with the numbers 40, 50, and 60.
// Expected Output: Display the array before and after the splice operation.
        let b=document.createElement("h1")
        b.innerText="original array"
        let arr2=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

        arr2.splice(3,3,'40','50','60')
        console.log(b);
        console.log(arr2);
        
// Task 3: Using slice
// Objective: Extract a portion of an array without modifying the original array.
// Task: Create an array of the days of the week. Use the slice method to create a new array that contains only the weekdays.
// Expected Output: Display the original array and the new array.
        let arr3=["Monday","Tuesday","Wednessday","Thrusday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"]
        let slicedArray=arr3.slice(5,7)

        console.log(slicedArray);

//Task 4: Using join
// Objective: Convert an array to a string.
// Task: Create an array of words that form a sentence. Use the join method to combine them into a single string with spaces between each word.
// Expected Output: Display the resulting sentence.
let arr4=['apple','banana','orange']
console.log(arr4.join(' '));


// Task 5: Using sort
// Objective: Sort the elements of an array.
// Task: Create an array of random numbers. Use the sort method to sort the numbers in ascending order.
// Expected Output: Display the sorted array.
let arr5=[1,4,2,5,3,7,6,10,9,8,11,12,15,20,21,30,35,38]
arr5.sort()
